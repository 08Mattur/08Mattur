ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt
Iâ€™m interested in software development - mainly C#/VB. 

I have experience in WPF, ASP.NET, Winforms, MVC, SQL. 
Also supporting knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
I have also used SSRS, SSIS and a tiny bit of SSAS.

My current interests are manipulating large data sets and making a front end analytical platform to check insights into the data.
For example I am currently working on a football predictor. Taking a match and looking into the strength of the home team vs the away team and coming up with a score prediction.
During this I am working on independant small projects to help improve my understanding of SOLID principles, OOP and Design Patterns:
  - Dice Roller (Listener/Observer pattern. The individual dice listen to a manager that tells them to roll.)
  - Pomodoro Tracker
  - Basic Football Data (Looking into just match data - eg the goals, fouls, cards of the match)
  - SOSCSRPG.COM (Following this tutorial to make a game)
  - Advanced Football Data (As above however on a player basis. This means calculating strength as an average of the players in the current team rather than the overall strength of the team,
    this will take into account injured players, top goal scorers being sold, or strong defenders being suspended.)
   
   
This is my portfolio where I will be putting the above projects for public viewing.
